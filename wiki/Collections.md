As we already said, collections are the core concept of pikimoni. They are used to define the elements that should be displayed on the page.

You can manage collections by clicking the collections button on the control panel:

This is where you can choose the collections of elements that you want to display on the page. Each page has got different kind of collections. At the moment we have Images, Audio and Text. Depending on the page, one or more collections might be needed.

You can create new collections or download existing collections from the cloud. See how to create a [[New Collection]] or how to [[Download an existing collection]].

# Collection's types

At the moment the colelction's types are:
* Images
* Images 2
* Audio
* Text

Each page needs specific types of collections, depending on the exercice. Some exercices need only one image's collection. In Jobs for example you only have to display one collection and the student must pick up one image.

Other exercices are a bit more complex and need two diffent kinds of images. For example drag and drop exercies where the student must move one image on top of another. In the feeding animals exercice for example we have two different kind of images: food (Images) and animals (Images 2).

Audio collection allows you to create a collection of audio files that you can play at any time during your lesson from the control panel.

In other exercices you might want to display a text. This is why we have text collection's type.
