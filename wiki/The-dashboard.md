Dashboard is your starting point. After login you will get on this page where you have a summary of your students and your lessons.

Here you can manage your students (see how to [[Manage students]]) and you can check student's homepage (see [[Student's Homepage]]). 

On the left you see a dropdown menu where you can choose the course. After choosing the course the list of available exercises will appear (see [[Sidebar]]).

This is also the place where to start a new lesson (see how to [[Start a new lesson]]).
